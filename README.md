🛒 Online Shopping – MERN Stack
📌 Introduction

This project is an educational Online Shopping web application built using the MERN Stack.
It is not a real commercial e-commerce site, but a learning project designed to help practice full-stack development concepts such as API design, frontend UI building, database management, authentication, and more.

⚙️ MERN Stack Overview

The MERN stack is a JavaScript-based technology stack used to build modern, fast, and scalable web applications. It consists of:

M – MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing products, users, orders, etc.

E – Express.js: Backend framework for building APIs.

R – React.js: Frontend library for interactive UI components.

N – Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for the server.

Together, these tools make it easy to build single-page applications with efficient performance and a smooth user experience.
